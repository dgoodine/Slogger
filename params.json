{"name":"Slogger","tagline":"A simple, fast and customizable logging framework for Swift","body":"## Why Another Swift logger?\r\n\r\nWhen I started doing serious Swift development, I naturally looked around for a logging framework.  I found *XCGLogger* by Dave Wood @DaveWoodCom (https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger).  While it's fast and well constructed, I needed some extra features and decided to build my own.  But I did learn a few things from him so he deserves some props. 🍺\r\n\r\n*Slogger* uses much the same approach and identical function signatures as *XCGLogger*, so it can be easily switched with *XCGLogger* without modifying existing logging sites.  If you want to try it as an alternative, it's should be relatively easy.  Be sure to check the **Advanced Features** section below to see why I decided to go this route.\r\n\r\n## General Info\r\n\r\nThe typical logger levels are supported:\r\n\r\n\tpublic enum Level : Int, Comparable {\r\n\t  case None, Severe, Error, Warning, Info, Debug, Verbose\r\n\r\n\t  static func allValues () -> [Level] {\r\n\t    return [None, Severe, Error, Warning, Info, Debug, Verbose]\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nEach log level has autoclosure and noescape trailing closure implementations, so the following are both valid forms:\r\n\r\n\tlog.debug(\"Enter\")\r\n\tlog.debug() { \"Enter\" }\r\n\r\nBy necessity, the function parameters include defaulted parameters to capture the source code information at the logging site.\r\n\r\nSetting up a logger can be as simple as one line of code:\r\n\r\n\tlet log = Slogger<NoCategories>(defaultLevel: .Debug)\r\n\t\r\nAnd you'll likely want to tailor your build for debug/release:\r\n\r\n\t#if DEBUG\r\n\tlet log = Slogger<NoCategories>(defaultLevel: .Info)\r\n\t#else\r\n\tlet log = Slogger<NoCategories>(defaultLevel: .Warning)\r\n\t#endif\r\n\r\nThe *Slogger* class is generic to support categories, as explained below.\r\n\r\nThe public interface documented in the headers.  See the Docs directory for an HTML-based version.  At some point there will be a docset available.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Features\r\n\r\n### Destinations\r\nThe *Destination* protocol allows you to write your own log destinations and add them to the logger.  This would enable you to add a destination to log over the network, for example.\r\n\r\n*Slogger* natively supports the following logging destinations:\r\n\r\nDestination | Status\r\n--- | ---\r\nConsole | Supported\r\nMemory | Supported\r\nFile | Coming Soon™\r\nNetwork | Considering it\r\n\r\n\r\n### Generators\r\nYou can supply your own closure for outputting a log entry in any format.  The default uses the following pattern:\r\n\r\n\t- [10/25/2015, 15:33:57.435 EDT] SloggerTests.swift:117 callIt [] Severe: Message...\r\n\t\r\nBut you could easily output custom JSON, XML, or whatever you want by supplying your own.  These generators are configurable per logging destination.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nYou can configure what details you want to see in the logs – and in what order – by providing an array of enum values for each detail supported.  This makes it easy to customize your output format.\r\n\r\n### Configurable Decorators\r\nYou can supply a decorator that will further adjust the format of the generator output.  These are configured per destination.\r\n\r\nDecorators | Status\r\n--- | ---\r\nXCodeColors | Supported\r\nANSI | Coming Soon™\r\n\r\n### Configurable Colormaps\r\nMake your own color map for mapping *Level* to color in a platform- and decorator-independent way.\r\n\r\n### Radioactive Tracing\r\nRadioactive tracing allows logging sites to execute based on a boolean *override* value, in addition to the logging level.  If the *override* argument at a logging site is *true*, the event is logged, regardless of the log level.  If the argument is *false*, log-level checking continues as usual.\r\n\r\nOne use-case would be where you have a *Request* object base class in a services implementation.  You could define a boolean *trace* property, defaulting to *false*, and in your code that processes the request, you would provide the value of *trace* as the *override* argument at the logging site.  If a particular request is causing a problem (but tons of them are being processed), you can set the *trace* flag for only that request, causing logging sites for all levels to be logged.\r\n\r\n### Categories\r\nIn addition to the two convenience functions for each level mentioned above, logging sites allow a *Category* to also be passed to the logging function.  While a category could be any type conforming to the *Hashable* protocol, you would typically define an *enum* for type safety.\r\n\r\nOnce the categories are defined, you can configure your logger to customize the logging level for that category (.Debug or .Verbose, for example), even at runtime.  This allows more fine-tuning of logging if, for example, you want to see more logging of the events for a particular concern (database calls, networking transactions, etc).\r\n\r\nThe design of *Slogger* is such that third-party frameworks can expose their log instance and document their category values for developers using the framework.  Then, if the developers need to diagnose a problem inside the framework, they can simply adjust the logging levels for particular categories to get more information.  This is particularly useful in cases where the framework developer doesn't release the source code.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Categories\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how you should implement your custom categories, taken from the unit test code in *Slogger*.\r\n\r\nFirst, define your category enum:\r\n\r\n\tenum TestCategory : String, SloggerCategory {\r\n\t  case First, Second\r\n\r\n\t  static func allValues () -> [TestCategory] {\r\n\t    return [First, Second]\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSecond, subclass the generic *Slogger* class to bind it to your category type:\r\n\r\n\tclass TestLogger : Slogger<TestCategory> {}\r\n\t\r\nThen create your logger in the obvious way:\r\n\r\n\tpublic let log = TestLogger()\r\n\t\r\nNaturally, if you want your logger to have customized values (generators, decorators, etc.), you can override the *init* method and provide that information there.\r\n\r\n*Slogger* is designed so that all public public properties for a *Slogger* instance can be modified at runtime, without having to worry about its internal state.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nHere's some initial performance timing for logging calls with a release build (as of version 1.0):\r\n\r\nDevice | Destinations | Level | Iterations | log.Debug(.Only, \"Message\")\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\nSimulator | [MemoryDestination] | .None | 100, 000 | 363ns\r\nSimulator | [] | .Verbose | 1,000,000 | 363ns\r\nSimulator | [MemoryDestination] | .Verbose | 100,000 | 28µs\r\nSimulator | [ConsoleDestination] | .Verbose | 1000 | 240µs\r\niPhone 6 | [MemoryDestination] | .None | 100, 000 | 921ns\r\niPhone 6 | [] | .Verbose | 1,000,000 | 943ns\r\niPhone 6 | [MemoryDestination] | .Verbose | 100,000 | 65µs\r\niPhone 6 | [ConsoleDestination] | .Verbose | 1000 | 718µs\r\n\r\n## How To Get it\r\nHere's how you can check it out:\r\n\r\nMeans | Status | Comment\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nGithub | Supported | https://github.com/dgoodine/Slogger\r\nCarthage | In process |\r\nCocoapods | In process | Not a fan of invasive development tools, but it's popular\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nPlease do use the issues section on Github to raise questions, offer suggestions for improvements or ask questions about the implementation.  And if you want to contribute (generators, destinations, etc.), feel free to discuss it in the issues section and/or issue a pull request.\r\n\r\nHappy logging!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
